The story begins with two children in a small town.
Cammy and Jesse. 
These two kids were friends, really close friends.
They knew that they could have the world as long as they were together.
They thought nothing was impossible.
The two got older and Cammy learned of a well.
A well that could make a person's desire come true.
However, this gift came with a penance, one that Cammy was willing to pay.
Cammy took Jesse to see this well, in the pouring rain. 
Telling stories of the beautiful wonders that can come from it. Jesse was skeptical.
As Jesse looked down into the well They couldn't see what Cammy was talking about.
It looked, sounded, and felt like any old well.
Then, before Jesse could get a grip on the well they were pushed in.
Falling all the way to the bottom they broke bones.
They couldn't move, looking up into the rain to the opening of the well.
The distorted face of their friend looking down. Slowly the face retreated into the darkness.
The water began to rise, Jesse couldn't think of a way out.
Then a bright light began to shine...
