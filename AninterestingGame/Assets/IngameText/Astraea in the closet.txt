Oh, you're awake.
I got tired of waiting for you in your room so I started to look around a little.
Who am I?
I'm Astraea your best friend.
It's strange the things that you don't remember sometimes.
Anyway, are you a little hungry, because I am.
Maybe we should go downstairs to see if we can find your Mother and see if she can make something for us.
Lets go.
